# 🕹️ Hand Gesture Controlled Ping Pong Game

A fun and interactive ping pong game controlled entirely using your hands, built with **OpenCV**, **cvzone**, and **MediaPipe**. Play against yourself or a friend — no keyboard or mouse needed!

## 🎮 How It Works

- Your webcam detects your **left and right hands**.
- Bats are controlled by moving your hands up and down.
- The ball bounces across the screen — block it with your virtual bat to score points.

- Score tracking for both players
- Game Over screen
- Option to restart the game with a key press (`r`)
